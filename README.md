dotfiles
========

My minimalistic dotfiles. Symlink or move this folder to ~/dotfiles and run:

    ./install.sh

It will:

* add a line to ~/.bash_profile to source dotfiles/index
* backup ~/.vimrc to ~/.vimrc.bak
* create a symlink from ~/.vimrc to dotfiles/vimrc

Please look at the files itself for further explanation.
